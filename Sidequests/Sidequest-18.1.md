# Sidequest 18.1: Back to Basics! Part 2

Start date: 28 October 2017  
**Due: 9 November 2017, 23:59**
 
    
In addition to battle training, the simulation room can be re-programmed for a variety of other roles and functions. Sometimes,
the simulation room is used to re-create foreign worlds for JFDI cadets to explore and to practise interactive with alien races and
alien creates in a ``safe&#39;&#39; setting.

In this side quest, you will get a chance to program a scenario for the simulation room.

**Sidequest Overview**

The simulation room will be reset to its original configuration. Your task is to achieve several broad guidelines, which we call _aspirations_ below, to form the basis of a simple text-based adventure game.

You are encouraged, but not required, to then continue to develop your adventure game and submit it for the contest.

## Task 1

[Aspiration One.] Create at least one additional class that extends from the `Person` class. This class should be able to act automatically, but should be able to respond to actions from either the player or other NPCs (non-player characters) in your game.

[Aspiration Two.] Create at least one new item that should have some role to play in your game. It may be an item that enhance the player's ability in some manner (i.e. a powerup), or it may be a key item required to win your game, for example.

[Aspiration Three.] Create at least one new type of `place`, a class should extend `Room`. This room should have some sort of special functionality or role in your game, akin to the generator room from the Death Cube simulation.

[Aspiration Four.] Implement some form of end-state for your game, for when the player wins or loses the game.

Good luck!

In addition to submitting the basis of your game, you are to include in your submission a readme section that introduces your game and that also describes how you achieved the four aspirations listed above.
